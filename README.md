# MetalX - Professional GPU Rendering Engine for iOS

![MetalX](docs/images/metalx-banner.png)

MetalX is a powerful, mobile-first rendering engine that brings professional-grade image and video editing capabilities to iOS. Built on Apple's Metal framework, it delivers real-time performance while providing the sophisticated features found in desktop applications like Photoshop, After Effects, and DaVinci Resolve.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎨 **Image Processing**
- **Professional Editing**: Complete suite of adjustment tools (exposure, contrast, saturation, curves, etc.)
- **Advanced Selections**: AI-powered subject/sky selection, color range, and manual masking
- **RAW Processing**: Full RAW pipeline with demosaicing and color science
- **Non-Destructive Editing**: Smart layers maintain original quality through any transformation

### 🎬 **Video Editing**
- **Timeline-Based Editing**: Multi-track timeline with real-time preview
- **4K/8K Support**: Hardware-accelerated processing of high-resolution video
- **Advanced Effects**: 100+ GPU-accelerated effects including particles, fluids, and motion graphics
- **Color Grading**: Professional LUT support and color wheels

### 📝 **Advanced Typography**
- **3D Text**: Bevels, extrusions, and glass effects with realistic shadows
- **Text Animation**: Keyframe-based animation with preset effects
- **Mesh Gradients**: Complex gradient fills and textures

### 🚀 **Performance**
- **Metal Optimization**: Leverages Apple's TBDR architecture
- **Intelligent Caching**: Predictive loading and smart memory management
- **Battery Efficient**: Adaptive quality based on device state
- **60 FPS Guarantee**: Maintains smooth performance even with complex projects

## 📱 Requirements

- **iOS**: 14.0 or later
- **Hardware**: iPhone with A12 Bionic chip or newer
- **Storage**: 500MB minimum (2GB recommended)
- **Memory**: 3GB RAM minimum (6GB recommended for 4K video)

## 🛠 Installation

### Swift Package Manager

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/yourusername/MetalX.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

### CocoaPods

```ruby
pod 'MetalX', '~> 1.0'
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

```swift
import MetalX

// Initialize the engine
let engine = try RenderEngine()

// Load and edit an image
let image = try await engine.loadImage(from: imageURL)
let enhanced = try await engine.process(
    image: image,
    with: Recipe()
        .exposure(0.5)
        .vibrance(0.3)
        .filter(.cinematic)
)

// Create a video timeline
let timeline = Timeline()
let videoTrack = timeline.addVideoTrack()
videoTrack.addClip(videoURL, at: .zero)
videoTrack.addEffect(.colorGrade(preset: .bladeRunner))

// Export the result
let output = try await engine.export(timeline, settings: .youtube4K)
```

## 🏗 Architecture

MetalX uses a modular architecture optimized for GPU performance:

```
MetalX/
├── Core/               # Rendering engine core
├── Effects/            # GPU-accelerated effects library
├── UI/                 # SwiftUI components
├── Pipeline/           # Metal pipeline management
└── ML/                 # Machine learning integration
```

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
swift test

# Run specific test suites
swift test --filter RenderingTests
swift test --filter PerformanceTests

# Run with Metal validation
export METAL_DEVICE_WRAPPER_TYPE=1
swift test
```
