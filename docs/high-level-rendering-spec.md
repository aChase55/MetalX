# High-Level iOS Metal Rendering Engine Specification

## Vision
Build a unified Metal-based rendering engine for iOS that handles both image and video processing with 70-80% of the power of professional tools (Photoshop, After Effects, DaVinci Resolve) while providing a simplified user experience through intelligent presets and composed operations.

## Core Objectives

### 1. Unified Architecture
- Single rendering pipeline that seamlessly handles both still images and video
- Adaptive quality system that balances performance vs. quality
- Real-time preview with background high-quality processing
- Battery-aware processing modes

### 2. Performance Targets
- **Images**: Process 50MP images with complex effect chains in < 2 seconds
- **Video**: Real-time 4K@30fps preview, 4K@60fps export on iPhone 14 Pro
- **Memory**: Stay within 2GB footprint for typical workflows
- **Battery**: Adaptive processing to maintain 4+ hour editing sessions

### 3. User Experience Philosophy
- **Presets First**: Complex operations exposed as single-tap presets
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Simple UI with advanced options available
- **Real-time Feedback**: All adjustments preview instantly
- **Smart Defaults**: AI-assisted parameter selection

## Technical Foundation

### Core Technologies
- **Metal 3+**: Latest GPU features including fast resource loading
- **Tile-Based Rendering**: Optimize for Apple's TBDR architecture
- **Unified Memory**: Zero-copy operations between CPU/GPU
- **Machine Learning**: CoreML integration for intelligent effects

### Architecture Principles
1. **Plugin-Based**: Extensible effect system
2. **Node + Layer Hybrid**: Internal node graph, layer UI
3. **GPU-First**: Minimize CPU involvement
4. **Cache-Heavy**: Aggressive intermediate result caching

## Key Differentiators

### 1. Simplified Complexity
- **One-Tap Professional**: Presets that combine 10+ operations
- **Smart Masking**: AI-assisted selection tools with compositing masks
- **Adaptive Quality**: Automatic quality/performance balance
- **Gesture-Driven UI**: Intuitive scrubbing and real-time preview updates

### 2. Mobile-First Design
- **Touch-Optimized**: Gesture-based controls with haptic feedback
- **Background Processing**: Continue editing while exporting
- **Cloud Integration**: Seamless preset/asset sync
- **Live Camera Preview**: Real-time effects on camera input

### 3. Performance Innovation
- **Predictive Caching**: Pre-compute likely next operations
- **Intelligent Tiling**: Adaptive tile sizes based on content
- **Effect Fusion**: Automatic operation merging
- **100+ Layerable Effects**: Complex effect stacking without performance loss

### 4. Advanced Creative Features (Inspired by Riveo)
- **Future Text**: 3D text with bevels, gradients, glass effects, shadows, reflections
- **Mesh Gradients**: Complex color transitions for backgrounds
- **AI-Powered Tools**: Automatic subtitles, masking, and filter suggestions
- **Keyframe Everything**: Animate any parameter with sophisticated easing
- **Particle Systems**: GPU-accelerated particles (smoke, fire, butterflies, etc.)
- **Fluid Simulations**: Realistic liquid and gas effects
- **Motion Effects**: Effects that respond to device movement
